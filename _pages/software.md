- [SBI](https://www.mackelab.org/sbi/) (python) - general purpose SBI framework
- [SBI Benchmarking](https://github.com/mackelab/sbibm/) (python) - for benchmarking
- [MadMiner](https://madminer-tool.github.io/madminer-tutorial/tutorial/0_intro.html) - aimed at particle physics
- [swyft](https://github.com/undark-lab/swyft) (python) the reference implementation of Truncated Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (TMNRE), an efficient, simulation-based inference technique for complex data and expensive simulators
- [carl](http://diana-hep.org/carl/) an early NN-based SBI package
- [lampe](https://github.com/francois-rozet/lampe) (python) is a flexible, amortized sbi library. The philosophy of LAMPE is to avoid obfuscation and expose all components so it is most useful for researchers.
- [pydelfi](https://github.com/justinalsing/pydelfi) (python) with neural density estimators and adaptive acquisition of simulations.
- [ABCpy](https://abcpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) (python) is for ABC and related methods (such as Bayesian Synthetic Likelihood), including backend for parallelization (MPI and Spark) and utilities to learn summary statistics with neural networks.
