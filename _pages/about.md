This site is maintained by [Kyle Cranmer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EZjSxgwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Jason Lo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=84y-HKEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). We are committed to turning this site into a valuable community resource. We're dedicated to collecting recent research papers on methodological developments and applications in the field of simulation-based inference. Our vision is to create a crowd-sourced platform, where users can access and contribute to the latest knowledge in this domain. It will probably be similar to [IRIS-HEP](https://iris-hep.org) webpages ([source](http://github.com/iris-hep/iris-hep.github.io-source)) and/or something like this [living review](https://github.com/iml-wg/HEPML-LivingReview).

Out site is in its early infancy. As we continue to build and refine the infrastructure, we appreciate your understanding and patience. While we have laid the groundwork for this community resource, there is still much to be done to realize its full potential. In these initial stages, we encourage users to provide feedback, suggest improvements, and participate in the platform's growth. By acknowledging its current limitations and working together, we can create a comprehensive, well-organized, and user-friendly hub for all things related to simulation-based inference. The success of this platform depends on the collaborative efforts of our community, and we are excited to embark on this journey with you. If you're passionate about simulation-based inference and would like to join our mission, we invite you to submit Pull Requests (PRs) to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/simulation-based-inference/simulation-based-inference.github.io). Your contributions could include adding new research papers, improving the categorization of resources, enhancing our platform's features, or offering insights to foster methodological advancements. By contributing to our project, you'll become an essential part of the community, helping to shape the future of simulation-based inference. We value every submission and appreciate the time and effort invested by our contributors. Together, we can create a powerful, inclusive resource that benefits researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts alike.
