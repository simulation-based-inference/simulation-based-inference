The Department of Physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison invites applications for a tenure-track faculty position in the areas of AMO or quantum physics, either theory or experiment. Successful candidates will have the opportunity to collaborate with existing quantum research at UW-Madison, within the Wisconsin Quantum Institute (WQI) and the HQAN and Q-NEXT quantum centers, with the UW Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC), and with external research centers. The Department of Physics has strong experimental and theoretical programs in qubit devices based on neutral atoms, quantum dots, and superconductors, as well as related areas of quantum materials, quantum optics, quantum sensors, and quantum information theory. Candidates must have a proven track record of innovation and high-impact research and are expected to build a vigorous, well-funded research program with international profile.
